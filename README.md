In a way, this place is meant to archive my Godot assets.

By storing assets away in here, i can reuse them in other projects and recover them if i lose my PC.

In here, you can do the following:
*Download my assets and experiment with them.
*Use my assets as placeholders so you can understand and learn Godot.
*Use my assets in your game as long as credit is given.

This is my first repository, so sorry if it isn't very understandable.
